# pangenome-spatial-genome
- analyzes all the genome from the pangenome point of view and for spatial transcriptomics.
- Two neovim vsplit, one for writing the bacdive and one for writing the pangenome-webpack. 
- does the metagenome assembly from the long reads and aligns them against the proteome. 
  - assembles the metagenome - completed
  - genome completeness - completed
  - genome annotation - writing the code.
